# About

This project is built using Angular 15, with an API Gateway backend. The files in `/server` are the lambda functions powering the backend. This project can be run without the need to set up your own API Gateway / Lambda functions. If you would like to explore this project without downloading the code, you can visit my deployment at https://scottmurray17.github.io/AngularTMDB/.

## Potential Improvements

* Page for individual people with their credits
* Test implementations and integration with build

## Known Issues

* When running the angular server locally, there is a CORS error between the browser and API Gateway on Firefox. This can be fixed by using private browsing, or using a different web browser.
